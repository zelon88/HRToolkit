<?php
// / This file contains the variables required to run core.php. These may be useful if they are required 
// / elsewhere, or if there is a problem and we would have undefined variables. Anything that would otherwise
// / be calculated by core.php or another required or included script will have an optimized default set here.
// / In the event of a missing var elsewhere in HRAI, these defaults should do the trick. For example, in a 
// / default situation where the core.php could not access it's own vars, the $CallForHelp variable here is
// / automatically set to 0, which will find us another available node to offload this servers workload. 
// /
// / We will include all our vars, but barely any includes or requires. There are no functions and barely
// / any logic in this script. 
// /
// / In order to correctly create and log sessions, and to provide learning based on userID we need to validate
// / WordPress. This simple logic will determine if the server runs WordPress, and will get some special vars if
// / it does. If it does not, we will define these vars with constants, just-in-case.
