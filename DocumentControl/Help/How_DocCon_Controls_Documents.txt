How DocCon Controls Documents

DocumentControl requires the config.php file to set the directory environment for DocCon.php. DocCon.php detects the directories environment from config.php and scans the "Pending Directory" under normal operation, or the "Action Items" directory whenever the "REPROC" flag is set, for files to be organized. During the scan DocumentControl reads the filename of each file detected and feeds it into a filtering algorithm to determine the type of document that was detected. Depending on the type of document being handled (Purchase Order, SO number, ect...), DocumentControl then queries the MsSQL or MySQL database configured in the config.php and gathers specific information to add to the filename of the file being handled. DocumentControl will then create a directory for the files being handled based on the information gathered in the database and put the file into the newly created folder. If a folder already exists the file is added to the existing folder. The files are then write-protected so that only the system (DocumentControl) may make changes. The filename is renamed during the copy process to reflect the information gathered from the database. DocumentControl then creates a logfile to store information relating to the files that were changed for autidability and rollback purposes.
